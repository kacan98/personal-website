I taught myself to code after doing marketing for a while, so I think a lot about the user experience side of things.\n\nI work with TypeScript, Angular, React, and C# mostly. I like figuring out how things work and making them work better. When I'm not coding, I'm usually reading about new tech or trying to break something just to see if I can fix it.\n\nAlways up for interesting projects or just chatting about code.",

## Overview

Git-to-JIRA Bridge is a comprehensive time tracking solution that bridges the gap between actual development work and time reporting requirements. Built to solve the tedious task of manual time logging, this system automatically captures development hours from Git activity and seamlessly syncs them to JIRA worklogs.

## The Problem

Manual time tracking is disruptive and time-consuming for developers. Traditional approaches interrupt the development flow and often result in inaccurate or forgotten time entries, making JIRA time reporting a painful administrative burden.

## The Solution

A 3-step automated workflow:

1. **üìä Data Collection** - Multiple flexible input methods:
   - Background tracker that monitors Git repositories in real-time
   - GitHub commits integration for historical data generation
   - CSV upload for existing time tracking data
   - Manual entry with user-friendly web interface

2. **‚úèÔ∏è Smart Editing** - Intelligent time entry management:
   - Automatic task ID extraction from branch names using regex patterns
   - Auto-populated JIRA task details when connected
   - Weekly/daily views with drag-and-drop editing
   - Bulk operations for recurring tasks

3. **üöÄ One-Click Sync** - Seamless JIRA integration:
   - Secure authentication with personal access tokens
   - Automatic worklog creation with proper task linking
   - Support for both JIRA Cloud and Server instances

## Technical Architecture

**Frontend**: React-based web interface with TypeScript for type safety and modern UI patterns
**Backend**: Express.js API designed for serverless deployment on Vercel
**Background Tracker**: Standalone desktop application for continuous Git monitoring
**Data Flow**: Real-time Git monitoring ‚Üí CSV generation ‚Üí Web interface ‚Üí JIRA API integration

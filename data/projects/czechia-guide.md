# Czechia Guide

People kept asking me for tips for what to see and eat in Czechia/Prague. So I coded this one!

## Features

- **Tourist Recommendations** - Curated list of must-see places and experiences
- **Food Guide** - Local cuisine recommendations and restaurant suggestions
- **Interactive Maps** - Location-based recommendations with map integration
- **Multi-language Support** - Available in multiple languages for international visitors
- **Mobile Friendly** - Optimized for on-the-go travel planning

## Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Astro with TypeScript
- **Styling:** Modern CSS with responsive design
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Content:** Static site generation for fast performance

## Key Learnings

This project introduced me to Astro's unique approach to static site generation and partial hydration. Creating a travel guide taught me about content organization, user journey mapping, and the importance of mobile-first design for travel applications.

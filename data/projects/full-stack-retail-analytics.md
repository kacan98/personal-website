# Supermarket Rating App

A simple web application where users can rate and review local supermarkets. Built as a learning project to practice full-stack development with Microsoft technologies.

## What it does

- **Rate Stores** - Users can give star ratings to supermarkets
- **Write Reviews** - Add text reviews about shopping experiences
- **Browse Ratings** - See what others think about different stores
- **User Accounts** - Simple registration and login system
- **Store Management** - Basic admin panel to add/edit stores

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** C# with ASP.NET Web API
- **Database:** SQL Server
- **Frontend:** Angular with TypeScript
- **Hosting:** Microsoft Azure
- **Authentication:** Basic JWT tokens

## What I learned

This was my first full-stack project using Microsoft technologies. I learned how to set up a REST API, work with Entity Framework for database operations, and connect an Angular frontend to a C# backend. Deploying to Azure taught me about cloud hosting basics.

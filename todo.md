- I would like to see some variations of the current styles. I am kinda getting sick of this dark blue. We should try to make it more... 2025 - the UX I mean...
- the cards in the Portfolio are... not the same height. They should be.
- the picture in About takes up the whole screen on smaller devices. That is too big. My face can cover the whole screen...
- check if there are any components that can be rendered on the server and are rendered on the client instead.

Also it should be possible to chat with the current CV and ask like "Why are you a good fit for this job?" and it should answer based on the CV content back and forth.

- [ ] Split up the CV adjustment code into multiple files. It's wayyyyyy too much in one file now.
- [ ] Add testing. The CV is... quite wobly and complex now and... breaking it is easier and easier.
- [ ] In the CV show the ULR of the items in lists. Like the project URL, or the company URL when editing! There should be two fields visible when I click the item. Now there is only one.
- [ ] Fix the input fields (e.g. CV Adjust) because the input field there is hard tied to state and it takes a very long time from pressing a key to seeing the result. It should be debounced.
- [ ] The loading component should have a solid background. Right now it is transparent and you can see the content behind it. It looks weird.
- [ ] After I have updated the CV with "Adjust CV" it shows sometimes some enty imputs that are not possible to dismiss by clicking delete or the checkmark.

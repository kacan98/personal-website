I think we shuld include some loop in AI that makes sure we do not add anything untruthful. Maybe ask first what the AI would add or change and then verify that it is true and first then modify the CV.

Also it should be possible to chat with the current CV and ask like "Why are you a good fit for this job?" and it should answer based on the CV content back and forth.
